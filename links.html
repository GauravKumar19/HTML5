    <h1>Creating Links In HTML</h1>

    <p>
        A link or hyperlink is a connection from one web resource to another. 
        Links allow users to move seamlessly from one page to another, on any server anywhere in the world.
    </p>
        
     <p>A link has two ends, called anchors. 
        The link starts at the source anchor and points to the destination anchor, which may be any web resource,
         for example, an image, an audio or video clip, a PDF file, an HTML document or an element within the document itself, and so on.

    <p>
        MySQL (/ˌmaɪˌɛsˌkjuːˈɛl/)[5] is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).[5][6] Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter,[7] and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.
    </p>

    <p>
        MySQL is free and open-source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License, and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses. 
        MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB, which was bought by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation).[8] In 2010, when Oracle acquired Sun, 
        Widenius forked the open-source MySQL project to create MariaDB.[9]
    </p>

    <p>
        MySQL is written in C and C++. Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a home-brewed lexical analyzer.[16] 
        MySQL works on many system platforms, including AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX, ArcaOS, eComStation, IBM i, IRIX, Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, Novell NetWare,
        OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Oracle Solaris, Symbian, SunOS, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare, Sanos and Tru64. A port of MySQL to OpenVMS also exists.[17]

     <h3 id ="or">Oracle</h3>
     <p>
        The word oracle comes from the Latin verb ōrāre, "to speak" and properly refers to the priest or priestess uttering the prediction. 
        In extended use, oracle may also refer to the site of the oracle, and to the oracular utterances themselves, called khrēsmē 'tresme' (χρησμοί) in Greek.
     </p>

     <p>
        Oracles were thought to be portals through which the gods spoke directly to people. In this sense they were different from seers (manteis, μάντεις) who interpreted signs sent by the gods through bird signs, animal entrails, and other various methods.[1]
     </p>

     <p>
        The most important oracles of Greek antiquity were Pythia (priestess to Apollo at Delphi), and the oracle of Dione and Zeus at Dodona in Epirus. 
        Other oracles of Apollo were located at Didyma and Mallus on the coast of Anatolia, at Corinth and Bassae in the Peloponnese, and at the islands of Delos and Aegina in the Aegean Sea.
